# üéµ Music Recommendation System using Lyrics (Content-Based)

This project is a simple **content-based music recommendation system** that uses the **lyrics** of songs to recommend similar tracks. Built in Python using NLP techniques, it leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to find songs that are lyrically similar.

## üöÄ Features

- Content-based recommendations using lyrics.
- Text preprocessing with `nltk`.
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- Cosine similarity for finding similar songs.
- Modular codebase with separation of concerns.
- Works with a dataset of 57,000+ songs.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle: Spotify Million Song Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics)
- **Format**: CSV with song titles and lyrics

> Note: The `spotify_millsongdata.csv` file contains cleaned song lyrics and titles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Clean text (lowercase, remove stopwords and punctuation)
   - Tokenize and vectorize using TF-IDF

2. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Compute cosine similarity between lyrics vectors

3. **Recommendation**:
   - For a given song, return the top 10 most similar songs
